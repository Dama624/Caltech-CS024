The program becomes trapped in the while loop. The quotient continues 
increasing for as long as the program can run (as remainder = remainder 
- divisor for divisor = 0 never changes the remainder, and thus the remainder
remains >=0). Interestingly, the value of the remainder shifts between FFFFF5 
(near max value) and A.
